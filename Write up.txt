The two features I have added to the Multimedia Web App are the "Search" and "Show Details" buttons.

Search Feature: The search feature allows users to search for specific files by their name. When the user enters a search query and clicks the search button, the app filters the files based on the query and displays only the matching files. This feature improves user experience by enabling quick and convenient file retrieval.

Show Details Feature: The show details feature provides users with additional information about a selected file. When the user clicks the "Show Details" button, the app displays the name, type, and size of the selected file. This feature enhances usability and helps users gather more information about the files in the app.

I chose these two features because they are essential for a multimedia web app. The search feature enables efficient file searching, especially when dealing with a large number of files. The show details feature improves the user's understanding of the files by presenting key information about them.

In terms of code implementation, the search feature filters the files array based on the search query using the filter() method. It updates the state variable myFiles with the filtered files, and the updated files are rendered in the UI.

The show details feature toggles the visibility of file details using the showDetails state variable. When the "Show Details" button is clicked, the state variable is toggled, and the file details are displayed or hidden based on its value. The file details are rendered in the UI using conditional rendering. we can also hide the details by clickong on "hide details" button

Overall, these features enhance the functionality and user experience of the Multimedia Web App, making it easier for users to search for files and access important file information.
