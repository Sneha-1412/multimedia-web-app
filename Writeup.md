# Description of the Two Features

## Search

The Search feature allows users to search for specific files within the Multimedia Web App. Users can enter a search query, and the app will filter the displayed files based on the query. It performs a case-insensitive search, matching the search query against the file names. The app dynamically updates the file list to display only the files that match the search criteria.

## Show Details
The Show Details feature provides users with additional information about a selected file. When a file is clicked, the app displays its details, including the file name, type, and size. By clicking the "Show Details" button, users can toggle the visibility of the file details section. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing them to quickly access relevant information about a file.

## Explanation of Feature Selection and Appropriateness
The Search and Show Details features were chosen as they address important usability aspects of the Multimedia Web App. The Search feature enables users to efficiently locate specific files without manually scrolling through a long list. It improves user productivity and helps them find the desired content quickly.

The Show Details feature enhances the user's understanding of the selected file by providing key information. It allows users to verify file properties, such as the name, type, and size, which can be crucial when managing and organizing multimedia files. This feature promotes transparency and empowers users to make informed decisions about their files.

## Explanation of Code Functionality
The provided code for the Multimedia Web App demonstrates the implementation of these features. The handleSearch function filters the file list based on the search query entered by the user. It utilizes the filter method to match the lowercase search query against the lowercase file names.

The handleShowDetails function toggles the visibility of the file details section when the "Show Details" button is clicked. It updates the showDetails state, which determines whether the details section should be displayed or hidden. The code conditionally renders the file details section based on the showDetails state and the presence of a selected file.

Overall, the code effectively incorporates the Search and Show Details features, enhancing the functionality and usability of the Multimedia Web App.
